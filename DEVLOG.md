# Dev log

Append-only log of what got built, when, and why — written at the end of
(or when pausing) any nontrivial work session on this project. Newest
entry on top. Not a changelog for users; a memory aid for future sessions
(human or AI) so nobody has to re-derive context from git log + guesswork.

Each entry: **what shipped**, **why**, **what's still open**.

## 2026-08-02 — Question review system (State Tax Officer)

**What shipped:**
- New backend on the `shiksha-dev` droplet, extending the existing
  `mpsc-api` FastAPI service (chosen over Supabase — already had Postgres +
  a working service there; see reasoning in chat, not re-derived here).
  - 6 new Postgres tables in the `mpsc_study` DB: `users`,
    `question_reports`, `question_corrections`, `question_comments`,
    `question_notes`, `mock_attempts`. All keyed by `(bank_id, question_id)`
    — bank-agnostic by design, so this covers State Tax Officer today and
    any future bank without a schema change.
  - Simple username+password auth (bcrypt + JWT, 30-day tokens). Closed/
    invite-only — no public signup endpoint exists on purpose.
  - Endpoints: login/me, submit/list-my report (complaint), public
    corrections read, comments CRUD, personal notes CRUD, mock-attempt
    history, and admin-only bulk-status + per-question correction +
    user list.
  - 4 accounts seeded: `gasey` (owner) + `admin1`/`admin2`/`admin3`
    (reviewers), all role=admin. Credentials were shown once in chat,
    not stored in any repo — ask the user if they need to be rotated.
  - Backend code now under git at `~/mpsc_api` on the droplet (wasn't
    before — no history prior to this session, see that repo's first
    commit message for why).
- Frontend (`src/lib/mpscApi.ts`, `src/lib/authStore.ts`,
  `src/modules/mpsc/{LoginPanel,QuestionReviewPanel,AdminPanel}.tsx`,
  changes to `StateTaxOfficerEnhanced.tsx` / `StateTaxOfficerPage.tsx`):
  - Login control in the State Tax Officer header.
  - Every question in the Question Bank tab: 🚩 Flag (submit a complaint,
    optionally suggest the right answer), 📝 My note (private), 💬
    Comments (public thread).
  - Admin-authored corrections overlay the static bundled answer/
    explanation everywhere a question is shown or scored — Question Bank,
    mock test setup/running/scoring, By Exam/Year — via one
    `getCorrections()` fetch merged into `correctedQuestions` in the
    parent component.
  - New 🛡️ Admin tab (role-gated): filter reports by status, bulk
    accept/reject with a shared note, or expand one report to set the
    corrected answer/explanation/public note and accept it in one action.
  - Progress tab now shows real mock-test history + flagged-question
    status, fetched from the API (was a "coming soon" stub before).

**Why:** user wants every question eventually reviewable (not just State
Tax Officer), with a real admin workflow — bulk triage plus per-question
correction — and users able to see whether their flag was accepted or
rejected, with the admin's note.

**Bugs found and fixed during this session (verified live in-browser, not
just compiled):**
- JWT `sub` claim must be a string per RFC 7519 — PyJWT silently rejected
  int user IDs with "Invalid or expired token", which looked like a CORS/
  header problem until traced with a bare decode/encode roundtrip.
- Admin corrections weren't reflected in the Question Bank until a full
  page reload — the parent's `corrections` state was fetched once on
  mount and never invalidated after `AdminPanel` applied a new one. Fixed
  by threading an `onCorrectionApplied` callback down to `ReportRow`.

**What's still open / not built:**
- Corrections only affect *answer/explanation* — they don't yet let an
  admin fix the question stem or options text (only the standalone HTML
  guide's static data can do that, via re-running the solve pipeline).
- No UI yet to browse *all* comments/notes across questions (only
  per-question, from inside that question's card).
- Not generalized to other banks yet (`mpsc-old-questions`, Polity Codex,
  etc.) — the schema supports it (bank_id is already a column everywhere)
  but no other module's UI has the Flag/Note/Comments panel wired in.
- No password reset flow — if an account's password is lost, it has to be
  reset directly in Postgres (`UPDATE users SET password_hash = ...`)
  using `mpsc_api/seed_accounts.py`'s `hash_password()` helper.
- `mock_attempts`/`question_notes`/etc. have no admin-facing "delete my
  data" or GDPR-style export — fine for a closed personal tool, would need
  attention before ever opening signup to the public.
