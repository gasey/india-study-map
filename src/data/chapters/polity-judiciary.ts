// JUDICIARY — one integrated pyramid (Art 124–147, Art 32)
//
// Authored concept:
//   "India's judiciary is a single pyramid with its apex in
//   Delhi — and its arms reach everywhere: one High Court can
//   serve four states (Gauhati), and one postcard from Bihar's
//   jails became the first great PIL."
